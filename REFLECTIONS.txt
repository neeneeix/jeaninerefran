						<p style="color:#504843;">In Grade 7, I remember learning about programs like Microsoft Publisher, which left both my dad and me confused and a bit disappointed. He would ask, "Science school kayo, baâ€™t yan pinag-aaralan ninyo?" since it seemed outdated compared to what my friends from other schools were learning.. like coding. I shared that feeling of anticipation, especially after hearing that the "real deal" of coding and web design would come in Grades 9 and 10. During that time, I was already experimenting with Carrd, creating simple websites without needing to code, but I always knew I wanted to dive deeper into real web development.<br><br>

Now that Iâ€™m in the first quarter of Grade 9 that anticipation has finally paid off and Iâ€™m truly thankful for this introduction to proper web development. Weâ€™ve covered essential topics like XHTML, HTML lists, HTML forms, hyperlinks, and tables. The lessons have been a great balance of hands-on activities and discussions, which have made reviewing for tests much more manageable. The way the lessons were structured helped me appreciate how websites are built from the ground up, and itâ€™s exciting to think that Iâ€™m now creating something realâ€”coding my own, or atleast starting to be able to code my own sites, which is what Iâ€™ve been looking forward to all this time.<br><br>

I'm also thankful to Ms. Uminga for how well the classes went, I'm thankful for how structured everything was. We had an ample amount of worksheets, the hands-on was always engaging (even with the crazy time crunch), the quizzes were reasonable (even if it made my head bleed), and we were given all the resources we needed to review and make this very portfolio! With the sufficient material and engaging lessons maraming salamat po Ma'am for a great intro to ICT 9. C:</p><br><img src="DIVIDER2.gif" alt="[]">
